    docstring: |
      Updates the provided UserIdentity object.  Throws NotFound exception if
      an existing version of UserIdentity is not found.  Throws Conflict if
      the provided UserIdentity object is not based on the latest persisted
      version of the object.

      NotFound: UserIdentity object does not exist

  unregister_user_credentials:
    docstring: |
      For now, permanently deletes the UserCredential object with the
      specified name.  The association between the UserCredential object
      and the UserIdentity object indicated by the passed user id is
      also deleted.

      Inconsistent: Multiple UserInfo objects matched name

  find_user_info_by_subject:
    docstring: |
      Return the UserInfo object associated with the UserIdentity object
      which is associated with the UserCredential with subject matching

  # Utility methods
  
  signon:
    docstring: |
      Validates the certificate. If legit, extracts the subject line and searches
      all UserCredentials objects looking for a match.
      - If found, a lookup is performed on the association to the UserIdentity object.
      If found, a lookup is performed to see if there is an associated UserInfo object.
      The UserIdentity object id is returned along with the boolean True to indicate
      whether a UserInfo object was found (this is a known user who has registered).
      - If not found, a new UserIdentity object is created, a new UserCredentials
      object is create, and an association is established between the two. The object
      id of the UserIdentity object is returned with the boolean False to indicate
      this is a new user who needs to register.
