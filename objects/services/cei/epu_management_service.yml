docstring: |
  Service to create, read, update and delete EPU definitions, EPU instances and Deployable Types.
  Deployable Types are definitions of Virtual Machine types, with all required contextualization.
  EPU definitions describe elastic, high available processing entities based on Deployable Types
  with information about parameterization, execution constraints and
  packaging that go along. EPUs are the deployed instances of EPU definitions.
