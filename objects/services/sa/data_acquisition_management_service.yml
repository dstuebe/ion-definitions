name: data_acquisition_management

docstring: |
  Services related to management of data acquisition flows into the system, such as from instruments,
  data transform processes and external data sources. Service orchestrates data acquisition and
  processing by calling DM Distribution and Inventory services. In particular, this service sets up the
  Data Producer object relationships, used to track data provenance
